# Math-Code-
This repository contains code created for various undergraduate and graduate classes that required MATLAB.  
Classes include: Engineering and Design Algorithms, Math Programming, Math Modeling I &amp; II and Numerical Analysis I &amp; II.


This particular repository is a bit of a mess and I will organize it when I have time.  Basically it consists of school homework 
and projects that I had to write in MATLAB. Some of the code is very old and some of it is new. Feel free to browse.
